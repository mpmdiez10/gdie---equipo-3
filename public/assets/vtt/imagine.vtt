00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Imagine there's no heaven

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's easy if you try

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
No hell below us

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Above us only sky

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Imagine all the people living for today

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Imagine there's no countries

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It isn't hard to do

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Nothing to kill or die for

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And no religion too

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Imagine all the people living life in peace

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You may say I'm a dreamer

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But I'm not the only one

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I hope someday you'll join us

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And the world will be as one

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Imagine no possessions

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I wonder if you can

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
No need for greed or hunger

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
A brotherhood of man

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Imagine all the people sharing all the world

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You may say I'm a dreamer

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But I'm not the only one

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I hope someday you'll join us

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And the world will live as one
