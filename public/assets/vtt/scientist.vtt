00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You don't know how lovely you are

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I had to find you, tell you I need you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Tell you I set you apart

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Oh, let's go back to the start

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Running in circles, coming up tails

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Heads on a science apart

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Nobody said it was easy

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's such a shame for us to part

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Nobody said it was easy

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
No one ever said it would be this hard

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Oh, take me back to the start

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I was just guessing at numbers and figures

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Pulling the puzzles apart

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Questions of science, science and progress

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Do not speak as loud as my heart

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
