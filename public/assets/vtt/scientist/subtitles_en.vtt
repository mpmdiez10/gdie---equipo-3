00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Come up to me, you too.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's no time for me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:33.670
You don't know how I find you, tell your unneeded, tell your asses I'm going to be with you. Oh, tell me a secret unless we are questions.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:01:00.330
All let's go back to the star Road in circles, come in and tell yours, heads on the signs, a pile of nobody said, Nobody said it was easy

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.000
It's such a shame for us to part

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.670
Nobody said it was easy

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:43.200
No, never said The Lord ever said, You would be this hard I'll take me back to the star Thank you. I was just guessing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.600
And numbers of fingers

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.670
Pulling the puzzles Pull in my paws, it was a pile

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.330
Questions of science, science and progress

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.400
The most weak and loudest and more Your sweet and slatter's in my heart

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.670
Tell me you love me Come I'm feeling the love in

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.670
Come back and hold me

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.330
Or rush to the start

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.200
Running the circles, chasing tales

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.670
Come in back as we are

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.330
Nobody said it was easy

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.000
But it's such a shame for us to part

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.670
Nobody said it was easy?

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.330
No, never said it would be so hard

00:03:01.330 --> 00:04:22.000
